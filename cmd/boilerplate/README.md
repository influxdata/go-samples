# Boilerplate Application

A basic application to help you get started writing an application against InfluxDB 
using the [Go client](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-go).

The following environment variables are required to be set:
- `INFLUXDB_ORGANIZATION` - The name of your organization
- `INFLUXDB_HOST` - The hostname of the InfluxDB instance or Cloud environment you are using
- `INFLUXDB_TOKEN` - A token with read permissions to the bucket specified in `INFLUXDB_BUCKET`
- `INFLUXDB_BUCKET` - The name of your bucket

This application provides the ability to write data for its users, setup tasks to 
downsample their data, and query that downsampled data.

  task[[task]]
  /setup-. create task .->task
  /ingest-- raw data -->task
  task-- downsampled data -->/query
```

From this directory with the environment variables above set in scope, run the application
with `go run main.go` to start the application listening on port 8080.

- Verify the application is running by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to see a welcome message.

- `POST` a request to the `/setup` endpoint to install a downsampling task for the specified user.
  
  ```
  {
    "user_id":"user1",
  }
  ```

- `POST` a request to the `/ingest` endpoint to write data for the specified.
  
  ```
  {
    "user_id":"user1", 
    "measurement":"measurement1",
    "field1":10002
  }
  ```
  
  
- `POST` a request to the `/query` endpoint to receive the latest data for the specified user.
  
  ```
  {
    "user_id":"user1",
  }
  ```
  
  The response is formatted as JSON.
  
  ```

    "tables": [
